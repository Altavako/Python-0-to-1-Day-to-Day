## Exercise

**Write a small script to show passwords or hints for passwords of different accounts from different website you're user.**

How it should go:
    - Create variables
        - website: e.g ```website1 = Facebook```
        - account_name: e.g ```account1 = myaccount@gmail.com```
        - password: e.g ``` password1 = 123456```
        - And more websites and counts and password
    - Print out the question for user to ask, ```"what website's password do you want to see"```
    - Print out options for user to choose
        ```
        1. Facebook
        2. Twitter
        ...
        ```
    - Show the account and password base on what user choose. E.g 
    ```
    If user want to see facebook, they press 1, and you have to print out account1 and password1.  
    And so on.
    ```
**Extra:**
    - Make it into a loop, so that when user choose an option and the account, password are printe, you ask an other question: "Do you want to continue? Y/N"
    - If user says Y or Yes or yes or YES or y, we start again from beginning, asking what website's password....
    - If user say N or No or no or NO or n, loop breaks and stop the script
