**The focus of the day was to complete the easy and medium mode of RPG game, to practice creating Classes, methods and logics**

- Please find the sample code of easy and medium mode in RPG-Game folder
- If you want to replicate the game, follow the [steps](https://github.com/dangquangdon/Python-0-to-1-Day-to-Day/blob/master/RPG-game/steps.md)  

## Push projects to Github
- Create a new github repository.
- Navigate to your project folder
- Create a [.gitignore file](https://zellwk.com/blog/gitignore/), and add files/folders that you should not push together with your project source code.
- run ```git init``` to initiate a git remote in your project folder
- run ```git add .``` to add everything
- if you want to check what are the files will be pushed, run ```git status```
- if you want to cancel adding the file, run ```git reset```
- if everything is fine, run ```git commit -m"write a message here"```
- last step, run ```git push origin master``` to push it to your master branch. (If you want to push to another branch, replace the ```master``` with your branch name)
