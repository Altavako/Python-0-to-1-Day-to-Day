**In this Python programme, we will not learn the concepts in an acacdemic way because this is not Computer Science Programme, I will simplify all the neccessary terms, however, sometimes I will mention the technical terms and you should remember it**

# What is programming?

- Programming in short is just to tell a machine/computer to do something that you want.
- And you do it using programming languages

## Programming languages

- Programming languages are categorised in different levels. The closer it is to machine language, the lower level it is, and vice versa.
- Machine language is binary language, which is only 0s and 1s. Machine does not understand Java, Python, Ruby,... or whatever programming language that you've heard of
- As shown in the pictures, Python, as well as other famous programming languages that you have heard of are mostly high-level, which mean it will need to be compiled and interpreted into Machine code of 0s and 1s

## How many types of programming jobs ?
**This list is an example of some types of programming jobs, not all, and there are might be different names for them as well**
1. Front-end developer:
    - This is the guy/girl that beautify the app, he/she codes out eveything you see in your browser or phone in terms of interfaces, design, colors, etc. This kind of developers work very closely with designers, or they are also a designer themselves.
2. Back-end developer:
    - This kind of developers are the one behind the scene. Their codes power the app/website that you're using. Whatever behind the pretty looking app you're seeing such as processing data, insert/call data from database, security, etc.
3. Game developer:
    - As the name, these guys write games, develop a story into lines of codes that you can interact with. They are also have to deal a lot with 2D and 3D graphics.
4. QA/Tester:
    - These guys are very important, they test other developers' codes to make sure the codes run as they are designed for
5. Algorithms developer:
    - This kind of developers are the most academic ones, they turn all scientific theories into real life application. E.g Google Map
6. Data Scientist:
    - This is a trendy term and the programming skill level could be from beginner level to PhD level. As its name, it mostly deals with data, analyse data, testing hypothesises, running algorithms, machine learning, etc.
7. Embeded System developer:
    - They are the ones work with lower level programming language, and write codes that power the hardwares we're using.
8. OS developer:
    - These guys build operating system software ( macOS, Linux, Windows )
9. DevOps:
    - The term is the combination of Developer and Operators, their roles are to monitor systems, scheduling updates or backups, maintaining system, etc
10. Language & Compiler:
    - These guys are the ones that also work with lower level language, develop higher level language and write compiling software to translate high-level language into machine code. There was someone used C to develop C++ and someone used C++ to develop Python
11. Full-stack developer:
    - These guys are the combination of both front-end and back-end developers. Not necessarily that they are the best in both, but actually, they understand how things go from both side and can get things done. They don't know about back-end well as the back-end developer, but they know more about front-end than them. And they know more about back-end than the front-end developers but cannot be good at front-end as the front-end guys.

# Python
**Python is one of the fastest growing programming languages (or maybe the fastest one) because of its wide-range of application. Basically every one can use it, software engineer, mathematician, data analyst + scientist, network engineer, finance officer + accountants and even kids**

**You might have heard about Python because of its application in Big data, data visualization, Ai and Machine Learning, automation, but you can also use Python for Web Apps, Mobile Apps, Desktop Apps, Testing, Hacking**

### But you can do the same with most of the programming languages. What make python special ?
- High-level:
    - The syntax is very user friendly and easy to learn
    - Code efficiency with fewer lines of codes
- Cross-platform:
    - means that you can run Python application in different operating system, Mac, Windows or Linux
- Hug Commmunity:
    - many people are using Python, so if you encounter difficulties, there are many people to ask
- Large Ecosystem:
    - There are plenty of tools, frameworks, libraries for you to use
